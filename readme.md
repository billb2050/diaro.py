# dairo.py

    This program reads a Dairo [android diary app] xml "like" file and extracts data for output. 
    
    I wrote this to learn the dairo format with plans to be able to update my Linux "RedNotebook" data withe the dairo data. 
    
    It also is a good place to put Pythons xml library to use.
